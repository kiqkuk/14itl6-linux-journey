Before starting over, a lot already happened.

I went back and forth between Arch Linux and Void Linux.
Both interested me in different ways.
In the end, Arch felt more natural,
especially with systemd and how things fit together.

Void taught me how to deal with missing things.
I had to make things work on my own,
and that shaped how I approach my system now.

I patched dwm and st and put them in their own repositories.
That time was fun and exhausting at the same time.
I keep those repos as a kind of memory,
not just configs, but a moment I enjoyed.

I also have a qutebrowser config.
It uses Catppuccin and a dark mode flag.
It started from a simple need:
I wanted proper dark mode, not inverted colors.

There are many small things that never got written down.
ACPI brightness handling.
Small fixes.
Little decisions I don’t fully remember anymore.

That missing context is why I’m starting this journey now.
